							<h2>Introduction</h2>
						</header>
						<p>In the <em>New York Times</em>, an article titled <em>The 36 Questions That Lead To Love</em> gained massive popularity. The article has 36 questions that are meant to be asked between two individuals and it is noted that after these questions have been asked, the two individuals will fall in love, or at least have a much closer bond. In this project, I seek to explore the effectiveness of these 36 questions when communicated through different mediums. The goal is to learn more about myself and the other person while also understanding how people are able to do so in different ways and the effectiveness of each way.</p>

							<h2>Texting</h2>
						</header>
						<h4>Background</h4>
						<p>I met him in high school and we were great friends throughout our four years there, but after going separate ways as we moved onto college our friendship had become a little disconnected. I felt this was a good opportunity to see if I could rekindle our friendship.</p>
						<h4>Process</h4>
						<p>We first greet each other with some simple greetings and catch up for about five minutes – talking about our separate college lives, our friends, and the usual. It’s always a nice time to catch up with an old friend. We then dive into the 36 questions. The first set was quite easy - we were able to basically guess each other’s answers although we haven’t talked too much over the past two years. It was a nice mood and everything was going smoothly, but at the same time I didn’t really feel as though I was getting to know him any better at that point. Our bond was growing closer – but I think this could have happened from talking about anything in comparison to the first set of questions. The second set had a much different feeling to it. I learned some things I definitely would not have known about him, but I could have possibly guessed anyway. It was almost like the feeling where you think you have a gut feeling about someone, but you’re probably to embarrassed to ask them about it; these were the things we discovered about each other in the second set. The third set had a much more serious tone. I could immediately tell by how our grammar began to change. In the first two sets, we had some funny words here and there with some “lol”s and some emoticons from time to time, but in the third set there was none of that. I began to appreciate him more for who he was and we were able to definitely learn more about each other. If it wasn’t for this interview, I most definitely would not have been able to explore the interviewee in this way.</p>
						<h4>Reflection</h4>
						<p>I don’t think text messaging inhibited the effectiveness of the 36 questions as much as I had expected. We were still able to learn more about each other – but I guess the feeling of awkwardness was not as great as we were unable to see each other during the process. The ability to learn about each other was not inhibited at all though.
						<br>
						The interview through the medium of texting / instant messaging was by far the longest to finish overall. I imagine this was mainly because communicating through text takes longer to simply write out, but also the thought process into each text becomes more detailed. The process of communicating through text was also very different in the sense that I could type a message, but if I was unsatisfied with my answer I could delete it and rewrite it before sending it – something that cannot be done in real-time speech. </p>

							<h2>Video Call</h2>
						</header>
						<h4>Background</h4>
						<p>I also met this person in high school. We were okay friends throughout high school, but she ended up moving to a different state in our senior year. We’ve kept in touch from time to time, but I wouldn’t really say I know that much about her. She was a bit busy as it is finals week so we rushed the interview a little bit to accommodate her schedule.</p>
						<h4>Process</h4>
						<p>Since she was quite busy with studying, we skipped the catching-up phase and went straight to the interview after our greetings. Unlike the last interview, I was unable to really guess any of the answers for the first set of questions and such was the same for her. In a way, this first set of questions also determines how comfortable you already are with the other person. Since we weren’t the closest of friends, this first set of questions really helped ease us both into the next two sets of questions. Through the next two sets, we were <em>really</em> able to learn more about each other. There were some things that I most definitely would not have guessed in my wildest dreams. Over the course of these next two sets, the tone became much more serious – although in the beginning it was already quite serious since we weren’t able to joke around as great friends are able to. Neither of us took any time to leave from the video call and were locked into the interview. After the interview, we caught up for a few minutes even though she was busy. Maybe because we got closer through the interview, she felt comfortable just sharing some of her personal life with me.</p>
						<h4>Reflection</h4>
						<p>The fact that the interview was through a video call almost eluded me. I felt as though we were basically in the same room, and except for a few connection problems from time to time, I would not have known the difference. However, this was much different from the medium of text messaging. I had to think about what I wanted to say before I said it, unlike in text messaging where I could “say” stuff and then delete it if I wanted to. I think being able to see my partner was important in this experiment as well. Being able to visualize how the interviewee was feeling and holding “eye contact” really strengthened the bond we created over the course of the interview.</p>

							<h2>Audio Call</h2>
						</header>
						<h4>Background</h4>
						<p>I met this person during my first week at Princeton. As a freshman in his first week of school, I was desperate to find some new friends before all the friend circles were created and I would be left stranded on my own. In this time, I became acquaintances with many people, lots of whom I still greet on my way to class today but do not really hang out with at all. Maybe through this interview process, we could have become friends like we could have become closer friends like we intended to be.</p>
						<h4>Process</h4>
						<p>Although this person lives only a few minutes away from me on campus, I wanted to do this interview through the audio call. I called him up and asked if he was busy since I didn’t tell him beforehand that I intended to do an interview with him. I asked for an hour of his time and he was glad to help me with my project. We didn’t really discuss much else and went straight to the questions. Per usual, the first set of questions went smoothly and set the tone nicely. This being my third experiment, my answers became more routine but it was still very comforting to allow myself to share these details with the interviewee as he also shared them with me. We moved onto the second set and again as usual the tone changed. However, I could only analyze my partner through his speech as I was unable to view his body language or facial expressions at all. Those small pauses or little bits of stammering really then became important. We went through the second set fine and moved onto the third. Again, this is where things became a bit more serious. It seemed as though my partner began to rush his answers a little bit and almost not really speak the whole truth. Initially I provided full detailed answers, but seeing this from my partner I began to do the same. We finished the interview in a little over an hour and said our goodbyes.</p>
						<h4>Reflection</h4>
						<p>I don’t feel as though any connection was created between the two of us. Other interviews felt as though I really began to know the other person and felt more connected. Although I did learn more about my partner in this interview, I didn’t feel that connection. Maybe this was because we weren’t really friends to begin with, but I feel as though the interview did not really make us closer as friends anyway. The fact that we could only hear each other seemed to play a very important role in this. I wonder what it will be like in our future encounters now.</p>

							<h2>Face to Face (Speaking)</h2>
						</header>
						<h4>Background</h4>
						<p>This person was one of my roommates last year. We are great friends and we see each other on campus all the time since we get meals together and take classes with each other. I’m not sure how much closer we could have gotten from this interview, but I thought if these 36 questions really worked we would be able to become better friends.</p>
						<h4>Process</h4>
						<p>We met up for dinner and then walked to Robertson Hall. Initially, I planned to do the interview outside at the tables next to the fountain, but it began to drizzle a little bit so for the sake of both of us we moved indoors. We joked around a little bit and discussed some class work but then began the interview with each other. Like in my first experiment via texting, I was able to guess most of the answers in the first set as was the same for him. We moved along smoothly in the first set into the second set. The second set also went quite fine without much awkwardness at all. I didn’t feel a connection growing any stronger between the two of us as we were already great friends, but I did learn a thing or two about him in this set of questions. Again, my answers were becoming more routine so I was able to speak without hesitating when I was asked the questions. I wonder if this helped alleviate the awkwardness in the sense that I was able to answer questions seemingly truthfully and fully but in reality I did not really have to think that much about the questions. The third set was again more serious, but some of the questions we were able to answer for each other. I think it was very helpful in the fact that we were face to face since we were able to actually visualize each other as was with the video call interview. However, simply being in a room with someone is still a completely different feeling than being in a video call. I retract my statement from before where I said that I felt the video call was the same as being in a room with the person. After we finished the third set, we walked to another building to work on some class work together as though nothing really changed – but I felt a bit closer to my friend.</p>
						<h4>Reflection</h4>
						<p>Being in a room with someone has a completely different feeling to it. It may not seem like a big deal at first, but when dealing with the serious questions there is a noticeable difference. I was able to become closer to my friend throughout this interview although I did not really create a bond since that had already existed in place. I think if I were to have conducted this face-to-face interview with a person whom I was less close with, the effect would have been much more tremendous.</p>

							<h2>Face to Face (Writing)</h2>
						</header>
						<h4>Background</h4>
						<p>I met this person in one of my classes my freshman year and we have been friends since. We’re not the closest of friends, but we work on problem sets together so I guess you could call us “problem set buddies”. The interview took place in silence, but we would take turns writing down our answers on a laptop and then view our answers together.</p>
						<h4>Process</h4>
						<p>This was definitely one of the weirder mediums to complete the interview through. Initially I had planned to do it by pencil, but I felt as though completing it through typing on a computer would have the same magnitude of effectiveness and would be quicker to complete. We met at a table in the Friend Center to complete our interview. Although the first set of questions went smoothly, I could feel the awkwardness as it was hard to stay in silence the entire time. However, we were still able to see other so body language became important. Our answers were short and crisp and we breezed through the first set. In the second set, our answers became a bit more detailed and we could see each other typing our answers. I noticed that my partner would pause at times and think. This is probably different from the texting scenario in that she would not have wanted to type something out and then delete it since I would have already seen her answer. My answers became routine but I tried not to type them out so quickly in order to not stress out my partner or make her feel as though she was spending too much time thinking about her answers. As we moved onto the third set, our answers became more and more detailed and I could tell by the look on her face that she was very concentrated. We moved through the last set slowly, and as we finished we discussed the interview in general. It was a nice experience to go through and I definitely felt a stronger connection with my partner.</p>
						<h4>Reflection</h4>
						<p>Simply being in a room with someone seems to create a different feeling, even if we were not talking. This medium was similar to a combination of texting / face-to-face speaking. I was able to write out my answers well and she was able to read over them. I think the fact that our answers were written out was important as well since we could read them over multiple times to fully absorb each other’s responses. I think this was one of the most effective mediums.</p>
